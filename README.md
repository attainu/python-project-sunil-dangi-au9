# MazeSolver
MazeSolver is a python script that finds the shortest path between Source and Destination in a binary maze of size (MxN).

>A binary maze is just a grid/matrix consisting of *0's and 1's*.  
>The 0's, in this case, represents inaccessible cells and 1's represent the accessible cells.  
>This means that we are allowed to traverse on the grid only through cells having value of 1.  
>  
>    Sample `[M=4]x[N=6]` binary maze:  
>    1 1 1 1 1 0  
     0 0 1 0 1 1  
     0 1 1 1 1 1  
     0 0 0 1 0 0
